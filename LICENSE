This license lets you use and share this software for free, as
long as you release any software you make with it. Specifically:

If you follow the rules below, you may do everything with
this software that would otherwise infringe my copyright in
it or any patent claim I can license that you would infringe
by using this software as of my latest contribution.

1. Release source code for changes you make to this software.

2. If you run or combine this software with other software in
   any larger program, release all source code for that program.

3. Release all source code for software that you analyze,
   change, or otherwise make using this software.

4. Ensure everyone who gets a copy of this software from you,
   in source code or any other form, gets the text of this
   license and the copyright and source notices above.

5. Do not make any legal claim against anyone for infringing
   any patent claim they would infringe by using this software
   alone, accusing this software, with or without changes,
   alone or as part of a larger program.

To release source code, publish the preferred form for making
changes through a freely accessible distribution system widely
used for similar source code, and license additional work on
terms at least as permissive as this license. If source code
has already been released, you do not have to release it again.

You are excused for unknowingly breaking 1, 2, or 3 if you
release source code, or stop doing anything requiring this
license, within 30 days of learning you broke the rule.
